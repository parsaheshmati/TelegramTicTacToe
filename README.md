Project Overview

Objective: To develop an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game accessible via Telegram with bot integration.
Features:

3x3 grid game with X (player) and O (bot) symbols in stylish colors (X in black, O in blue with glow effect).
Smooth fade-in animations and hover effects on a blue gradient background.
Random bot moves with a delay for a realistic feel (upgradable to Minimax algorithm).
Score tracking (wins, losses, draws) stored using JSON.
Deployed on an HTTPS server.


<h2>Technologies: üí° </h2>

Python: For the bot using the pyTelegramBotAPI library.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the Mini App interface and game logic.
Telegram Web App API: For integrating the game with the bot.



<h2>How to Run ‚ùì wwwwwwwwwwwwwsswww</h2>

Prerequisites:

Python 3.x installed.
Install the pyTelegramBotAPI library with pip install pyTelegramBotAPI.
Create a Telegram bot via BotFather and obtain its token to add in bot.py.


Setup Steps:

Upload the index.html file to an HTTPS server (e.g., Vercel or personal hosting).
Configure the bot.py file with the bot token and Mini App URL (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/index.html).
Run the bot with python bot.py.
Start the game in Telegram with the /start command.


BotFather Configuration:

Use the /setmenubutton command in BotFather and enter the HTTPS URL of the Mini App.
